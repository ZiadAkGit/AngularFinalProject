# 🎉 FinalProject

Welcome to **FinalProject**, the ultimate Angular project by **Ziad Abu Khadra & Nour**! 🚀 This project was built using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.2.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Before running the project, make sure to install all required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
This will download and set up the `node_modules` folder.

### 2️⃣ Start the Angular Development Server
Run the following command to start the local development server:
```bash
ng serve
```
Once started, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/). The app will automatically reload when you modify any source files.

### 3️⃣ Start the JSON Server (Fake Backend)

If you haven't installed `json-server`, you can install it globally by running:
```bash
npm install -g json-server
```
For database operations, start the JSON server by running:
```bash
json-server --watch public/assets/users.json --port 3000
```
This will create a local API at `http://localhost:3000/` that serves user data.

### 4️⃣ Enjoy! 🎉
Now, explore the project, test its features, and have fun! 😃
